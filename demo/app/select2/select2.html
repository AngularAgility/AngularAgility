            There are a few other Select2 directives out there. This one is specifically designed to
            <strong>easily</strong>
            work with binding ids, objects, arrays, AJAX queries etc. for some pretty common use cases (see examples!)
        </p><br/>
        <p>
            It abstracts away the complicated Select2 API with a $settings object (lots of examples below!) and should make it
            pretty easy to do a lot of things.
        </p><br/>
        <p>
            It offers no support for the basic 'replace a &lt;select&gt; list and &lt;option&gt;' functionality.
            If you want that take a look at <a href="https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-select2">this one</a>.
        </p><br/>

        Take a look at the examples below to see what this one does readily and feel free to copy paste!
    </div>


    <div ng-controller="select2example1">
        <h1>Basic Id Example</h1>
        <div class="form-group select2">
            <label class="col-sm-2 control-label">State: </label>
            <div class="col-sm-3">
                <div aa-select2="select2Config" ng-model="selectedStateAbbreviation"></div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <br/>
        <div class="alert alert-info">
            <p>
                $scope.selectedStateAbbreviation = {{ selectedStateAbbreviation }}
            </p>

            <p>
                Very basic. The bound ng-model value selectedStateAbbreviation is just the "abbreviation" for the state.
                Ex "MN". This is called 'id' mode by the directive since we are just storing the id.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>


    <div ng-controller="select2example2">
        <h1>Basic Object Example</h1>
        <div class="form-group select2">
            <label class="col-sm-2 control-label">State: </label>
            <div class="col-sm-3">
                <div aa-select2="select2Config" ng-model="selectedStateObject"></div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <br/>
        <div class="alert alert-info">
            <p>
                $scope.selectedStateObject = {{ selectedStateObject | json }}
            </p>

            <p>
                A little more complicated. ng-model is bound to "selectedStateObject" which is an object representing
                the currently selected state. This is called 'object' mode by the directive since we are binding full objects
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div ng-controller="select2example3">
        <h1>TODO: AJAX Id Example</h1>
    </div>

    <div ng-controller="select2example4">
        <h1>AJAX Object Example</h1>
        <div class="form-group select2">
            <label class="col-sm-2 control-label">State: </label>
            <div class="col-sm-3">
                <div aa-select2="select2Config" ng-model="selectedStateObject"></div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <br/>
        <div class="alert alert-info">
            <p>
                $scope.selectedStateObject = {{ selectedStateObject | json }}
            </p>

            <p>
                Using AJAX search for a state as it is typed. ng-model is bound to "selectedStateObject" which is an object representing
                the currently selected state. This is called 'object' mode by the directive since we are binding full objects
